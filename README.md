This grammar describes a standard message from the [SL Errata](https://www.scientificlinux.org/author/sl-errata/) mailing list. A message parser can be created by passing this grammar to a parser generator like [Grako](https://bitbucket.org/apalala/grako).

This is useful for writing scripts which need to react automatically to errata updates issued for particular packages, or distribution releases or architectures, etc.
